MRC p15, 0, r1, c1, c0, 0 ; read CP15 Register 1 
ORR r1, r1, #0x1 	  ; bit 0 to 1 to enable MMU
MCR p15, 0, r1, c1, c0, 0 ; enable MMUs


Once MMU is enabled:
page table stuff:
cp15 c0, c2, ...


ALL WRONG
#will start with static mapping.
#TLB entry overview:
#CAM with VA tag (to see if translation is in the table) and preserved and valid bits, and size info
#31:12 11:4 3        2     1:0
#VATAG rsrv preserve valid page size (0x3 for 16MB)
#RAM with virtual address tag as well as the endianness, element size, and mixed parameters
#31:12 11:10 9          8:7       6     5:0
#PATAG rsrv  endianness elem size mixed reserved

for 16MB pages it shoudl be 31:24 bits for the tag

3.2.57 in Coretex-A8 manual for shoving entries into te TLB

was brought into the TLB with the ASID that matches the current value held in the CONTEXTIDR, 
see c13, Context ID Register (CONTEXTIDR) on pageB3-153. 
... not sure exactly what the entries should look like in the TLB
